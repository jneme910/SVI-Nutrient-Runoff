Final thoughts:
1. The SLD mechanism is clumsy for thematic maps and the resultant maps neither as fast to create nor as clean for polygon labeling compared to the default maps. A better approach would be to roll in some extra URL parameters for layers using names that start with:
po mapunitpolygon
pt mapunitpoint
ln mapunitline
pox mapunitpolygonthematic
ptx mapunitpointthematic
lnx mapunitlinethematic
pot mapunitpolygpnthematic
ptt mapunitpointthematic
lnt mapunitlinethematic
These would be followed by an underscore and the attribute name as appropriate to the layer.
_nl no labels (edfault is to show lables if scale-appropriate)
_po polygon fill opacity (0.0 for transparent, 1.0 for opaque)
_ls label font size (pixels)
_lc label color, six hex digits (rrggbb values, each color from 00 to ff)
_pc polygon border color, six hex digits (rrggbb values, each color from 00 to ff)
_pw polygon border width (pixels), from 0.0 to 50.0
Unspecified values default to the WSS default values.

For example one of the CD value sets would be replaced by:
pot_ls=22&pot_lc=FFAA00&pot_pc=FFAA00&pot_pw=4
This could be introduced without breaking current

2. Consequences for SDA for the above-suggested changes:
a. The command parser would need to be modified to support the new arguments.
b. The command parser test set would need to be extended.
c. The mapfile template file might be restructured to be less unwieldy to
edit and fasster to interpolate new values.
d. The Web Services help file would need to show these additional parameters.

3. The ordering of legend records in the AoiSoilThematicMapLegend does not preserve the load order sequence. It may be possible to fix this in the stored procedures
bafsdacache.dbo.SDA_LoadAdHocInterpretation
sdmonline.dbo.SDA_LoadAdHocInterpretation

4. SDA still needs a repair for presentation of WSS interpretations - the parameter
"thematicmapid" is not properly handled.
