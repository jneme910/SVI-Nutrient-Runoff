# SVI-Nutrient-Runoff

CPTAD has initiated a project with RAB to incorporate a LiDAR enhanced version of SVI into a pre-planning analysis mapping for planners to use in Conservation Desktop.  The first theme for the pre-planning analysis they would like to develop mapping for is sensitive areas for nutrient runoff, using soils info and high resolution elevation data to identify those vulnerable areas within land units. The SVI categorizes inherent vulnerability to nutrient loss (via subsurface and subsurface pathways), and the goal now is to enhance that with topographic data.
